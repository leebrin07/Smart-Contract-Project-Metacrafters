## Introduction 

This code is a smart contract written in Solidity, a programming language for Ethereum blockchain. The contract defines a token named Brian with the symbol Chandigarh University. The contract has two functions: mint and burn. The mint function allows anyone to create new tokens and add them to the total supply and their own balance. The burn function allows anyone to destroy their own tokens and reduce the total supply and their own balance. The contract also keeps track of the balances of each address that owns the token.

## Code Explanation 

The first line of the code is a comment that specifies the license of the contract. This is a standard practice for open source contracts to avoid legal issues. The license used here is MIT, which is a permissive license that allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the code as long as they give credit to the original author and include the license notice. The second line of the code declares the version of Solidity that the contract is compatible with. This is important to ensure that the contract works as intended and does not have any unexpected bugs or vulnerabilities due to changes in the language syntax or features.
The third line of the code defines the name of the contract, which is Tokens. This is a descriptive name that indicates what the contract does. The contract name should follow the naming convention of using uppercase letters for the first letter of each word.The next three lines of the code declare three public state variables that store some basic information about the token. Public state variables are accessible by anyone and can be read from outside the contract. The variables are:

tokenName: This is a string variable that holds the name of the token, which is Brian. This is a human-readable name that can be used to identify the token.
tokenSymbol: This is a string variable that holds the symbol of the token, which is Chandigarh University. This is a short abbreviation that can be used to represent the token in trading platforms or wallets.
totalSupply: This is a uint256 variable that holds the total number of tokens in existence. This is an unsigned integer variable that can store large numbers up to 2^256 - 1. The initial value of this variable is zero, which means no tokens have been created yet.

The next line of the code defines a mapping that associates each address with a uint256 value. A mapping is a data structure that allows to store key-value pairs, where each key can be mapped to a unique value. The mapping here is called balances and it keeps track of how many tokens each address owns. The key type is address, which is a 20-byte value that represents an Ethereum account or smart contract. The value type is uint256, which is the same as the totalSupply variable.

The next line of the code defines an external function called mint. External functions are callable by anyone and can be executed from outside the contract. The function takes two parameters: _to and _value. The parameter names start with an underscore to indicate that they are local variables and not state variables. The parameter types are:

```
_to: This is an address parameter that specifies who will receive the newly created tokens.
_value: This is a uint256 parameter that specifies how many tokens will be created.
The function body consists of two statements:

totalSupply += _value: This statement increases the totalSupply variable by adding the _value parameter to it. This means that new tokens are created and added to the total supply.
balances[_to] += _value: This statement increases the balance of the _to address by adding the _value parameter to it. This means that new tokens are transferred to the _to address.

```

The next line of the code defines an external function called burn. External functions are callable by anyone and can be executed from outside the contract. The function takes one parameter: _value. The parameter name starts with an underscore to indicate that it is a local variable and not a state variable. The parameter type is uint256, which is the same as the totalSupply and balances variables.

```
The function body consists of three statements:

require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value, “Insufficient balance”): This statement checks if the balance of the msg.sender address is greater than or equal to the _value parameter. The msg.sender address is a special variable that holds the address of whoever calls the function. The require function is a built-in function that validates a condition and reverts (cancels) the transaction if it fails. The second argument of the require function is an optional error message that can be displayed if the condition fails. 
In this case, if the balance of msg.sender is less than _value, then
```

## Feature 

One feature of the contract is that it allows anyone to create and destroy tokens without any restrictions or permissions. This means that the token supply is flexible and can change according to the demand and preferences of the users. However, this also means that the token value is not stable and can be affected by inflation or deflation. Therefore, users should be careful when using the token and understand the risks and benefits of the contract.

## Deployment 

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the code from solidity-project.sol file into your file:

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to latest solidity version (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the your contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint, burn function and much more.
